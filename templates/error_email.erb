Hi <%= sqs_message['email'] %>

There was a problem in a recent '<%= sqs_message['action'] %>' operation.
Here are the details.

The <%= sqs_message['barcodes'].length %> barcode(s) that were attempted to be altered were: <%= sqs_message['barcodes'].join(',') %>.
There were <%= all_errors.keys.length %> problematic updates.

DETAILS:
<% all_errors.each do |barcode, errors| %>
<%= barcode %>:
  <% errors.each do |error| %>
      * <%= error %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>

Any barcodes not mentioned have been updated.
